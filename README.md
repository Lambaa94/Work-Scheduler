# Work-Scheduler

## Description

Local storage. My friend and my enemy. I struggled through to finally get something to save and load on the page but what is done is done. Going through this process I definitely learned something. When you think you are far from the answer it is actually right in front of you. You just need to problem solve your way out of it with the resources at hand. I enjoyed working on this quite a bit because I am starting to really understand the fundamentals of programming and how everything connects together. Learning *JQuery* has shed a new light on the world and has made it much easier to communicate.

I started off this assignment with hard coding in my blocks of time. I could have used JQuery to do this but I didn't want to dynamically change the boxes. I just wanted to change and save what was inside of them. I started mapping out how I could go about this and decided to see how I can do this in not a ton of code. I wanted to keep it short and sweet so it would be easier to read then making 8 different storage points and so on. As I progress I am learning how to shorten up all of the tasks I'm doing.
